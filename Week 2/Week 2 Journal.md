# Introduction 
This is my Journal for Week 2. This week we were tasked to find a local historic graveyard and begin the process of collecting data. I will aim to relate my experiences from this week to this weeks reading and reflection materials.

## Resonances

"the study of an Indigenous burial ground requires an understanding of different ethical dimensions to archaeological practices" (Lacy, 58)
	
This quote resonated with me because it demonstrates the ethical dimensions to doing archaeological work with burial grounds. To disregard the culture and practices of indigenous or other communities is an infringement on their rights as people, regardless if they are living or dead. I feel it is especially important to be sensitive to these ethical dimensions in the context of burial grounds/Cemeteries as the dead cannot speak for themselves. It becomes the responsibility of the community to ensure they are respected, and to provide guidence to archaeologists in understanding these ethical dimensions. 

## Response to the Prompts

_you can respond explicitly to the prompts, or consider what the biggerr issue is that the prompts are driving at, and respond to that. Connect what you did with what you read/thought._

During the podcast for this week, Robyn S. Lacy spoke about the challenges facing mortuary achaeology including the "white washing" of 17th century colonies and the idea of the "good death". This made me think about how my own perceptions of our history have been shaped by the exposure to this bias. While recording gravestones, I had my own mental image of what that person may have looked like. When I read the name John Cameron, I pictured a white man. In reality, I have nothing to support that mental image. Furthermore, in historical cemeteries there are sometimes "famous" people who are commemorated there. At the cemetery I chose, Cairine Reay Mackay Wilson is buried there. Cairine Wilson was a Canadian stateswoman, and was elected as the first female senator. Although it is important to remember women like Cairine Wilson, it is equally important to consider the "meaningful silences" present in historical cemeteries. In other words although Cairine Wilson may be a prominent historical figure, there may be other individuals who are just as historically significant and worthy of celebration that are simply not represented due to racial, economic, or cultural factors.
