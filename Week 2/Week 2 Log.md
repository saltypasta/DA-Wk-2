# what I was trying to do

_Find a local historic graveyard to record data to be used in the graveyard project._

+ link to the relevant github repo: like this: `[repo title](https://github.com/your-user-name/relevant-repo)`

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

_The data I collect now will be used in later portions of the project. The kind of data I record an what data I choose to record will have an impact on the insights I can make later_

## what I did

+ Located a historic cemetary (relatively) close to me called "Dales Cemetary"
	+ Found this on findagrave.com aswell.
+ Took a sattelite image of the cemetary from google maps and traced over it with msPaint
+ Made abbreviation for this cemetary "OCDC" (Ottawa Cumberland Dales Cemetary)
	+ used this for "Burial Ground Code" in the following form: https://ee.kobotoolbox.org/x/uIGvnNmd
+ Filled out the appropriate gravestone and individual forms to the best of my ability
	+ See challenges for issues encountered when working from a digital image instead of the physical stone
+ 

_drop images, screenshots as relevant into the vault, link to them here. Use backticks to copy in relevant code snippets etc_

```
# example R code
data <- read.csv("data")
```

## challenges 

_I was unable to go to a graveyard this week. Im hoping to be able to go to one in week three_
+ Can't find "denomination" for Dales Cemetery
+ Have to guess material from image and googling
+ no way to measure dimensions
+ no way to know where the stone is located in the cemetary
+ no way to know which way the stone is facing 
+ Cant see all of stone in some photos, meaning I could be missing motifs or other text, materials etc.
+ Not sure if someone is buried or commemorated just based on the photo
+ Had to rezize an image that was too large to upload... Which means I lost resolution in the uploaded image. I could see how this might effect the readability of a less than perfect gravestone

## thoughts on where to go next

_I will aim to visit the graveyard I chose on findagrave.com in week 3 to obtain the missing pieces of data I may need later in the project._
